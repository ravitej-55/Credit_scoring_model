Credit Scoring Model:
   Objective:
Predict an individual's creditworthiness using past financial data with machine learning classification algorithms.

Features:
* Feature engineering from financial history (income, debts, payment history)
* Model built using Logistic Regression
* Model evaluation using Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC metrics

Dataset:
The dataset includes:
*  income: Annual income (numeric)
*  debts: Total debts (numeric)
*  payment_history: Payment history (categorical: good, average, poor)
*  creditworthy: Target label (1=creditworthy, 0=not creditworthy)

Workflow:
 1.) Load Data: Import finance dataset and preprocess features
 2.) Train Model: Build credit scoring model with Logistic Regression
 3.) Evaluate: Display classification metrics and ROC-AUC score

How to Run:
   1.) Open the notebook in Google Colab.
   2.) Run cells in order to reproduce results.
   3.) Review accuracy and metrics.
